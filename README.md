NWMSU Capstone Project: Analysis of MLS data.
## Project Overview
This project is to identify if there is a correlation between MLS win/loss ratio and match attendance. In order to investigate this topic MLS yearly club stats will be used to determine a win/loss ratio for each year. To calculate this ratio the total number of regular season wins will be divided by the total number of regular season losses. This ratio will be analyzed using advanced analytical techniques to determine if there is a correlation between win/loss ratio and the average match attendance.
