NWMSU Capstone Project: Analysis of MLS data.
## Project Overview
This project is to identify if there is a correlation between MLS win/loss ratio and match attendance. In order to investigate this topic MLS yearly club stats will be used to determine a win/loss ratio for each year. To calculate this ratio the total number of regular season wins will be divided by the total number of regular season losses. This ratio will be analyzed using advanced analytical techniques to determine if there is a correlation between win/loss ratio and the average match attendance.
## Data Used
 To fully investiget this question, data will be pulled from two different web sources. Both datasets contain unique information that will play a vital throughout this project. The following sections will take a deeper look at both of these datasets and the elements contained within them.

This data was cleaned and transformed following the steps that can be found in the MLS-Capston.ipynb. The final result of the transformed data can be seen in the merged_df

## Machine Learning Models

This project will investigate these variables using 2 different machine learning models. The first is a Linear Regression Model, and the second is a Polynomial Regression Model. All execuded code, charts and results for these models can be found in section 7 through section 12 in the MLS-Capstone.ipynb.
